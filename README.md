# üß† Bone Age and Final Height Predictor

**Predict bone age from X-ray images and estimate final adult height using biological maturity and genetic target!**

This project uses a deep learning model based on **ConvNeXt-Tiny** combined with **tabular features** to predict a child's **bone age** from hand X-ray images.  
It then calculates the **expected final height** using **chronological age**, **bone age**, **current height**, and **parental heights**.

## üìä Model Overview

- **Image Backbone:** ConvNeXt-Tiny (pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on X-rays).
- **Tabular Input:** Sex (encoded as binary).
- **Final Layers:** Combined CNN + tabular MLP, ending in a single regression output (bone age in months).
- **Loss Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer:** Adam.
- **Evaluation:** MAE, MSE, R¬≤ Score, Classification Report (by bone age ranges).

## üìà Final Height Prediction Logic

After predicting **bone age**:

1. Calculate **maturity status** (Normal, Advanced, Delayed).
2. Estimate **residual growth** based on bone age (custom growth table).
3. Predict final height = **current height + expected growth**.
4. Clip prediction within **genetic target bands** based on parental heights.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Disclaimer

Due to licensing restrictions, **the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset is not included** in this repository.

You must **download it manually** from the official RSNA page:

‚û°Ô∏è [RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge](https://www.rsna.org/rsnai/ai-image-challenge/rsna-pediatric-bone-age-challenge-2017)

Once downloaded:
- Place the images and annotation CSVs accordingly.
- Update paths if necessary in the notebook.

## üì∏ App Demo

The Gradio app allows users to:

- Upload a **hand X-ray**.
- Enter **chronological age**, **current height**, **father's height**, **mother's height**, and **sex**.
- Instantly get:
  - Predicted Bone Age
  - Expected Growth Remaining
  - Predicted Final Height
  - Genetic Target Height
  - Allowed Height Range
